A play on Amazon.com, Bamazon is an app that allows a user to be either a consumer or a manager. 

In the "Consumer" role, the user can look at a list of items and choose what they would like to buy, and how many.

In the "Manager" role, the user gets a dropdown menu to choose from. 


They can choose to viewa all the current inventory,


To view only products with stock lower than 5 items, 

To restock any item listed,

Or to add a new item to the total store inventory. 


The technologies used are MySQL and Node.js.
